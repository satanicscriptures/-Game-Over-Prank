# Game-Over-Prank
#Python script for a "Game Over." malware-prank application. Teaching tool; for beginners.
=======
#A simple python APP that opens a GUI conatiner with a "click here" button. When pressed, the monitor 
#screen goes black and a "GAME OVER" red font appears. The mouse is disabled 
#and the screen remains like this, seemingly succumbing to malicious malware offensice attack, as
#the P.C. tower (if applicable) beeps every 10 seconds until 2 minutes pass. At this point the app 
#container as if nothing happened-much to the relief of any surely panicked potential victim. Simply set 
#root.after(10000, beep), it schedules the beep() function to be called after 10,000 milliseconds (or 10 
#seconds) have elapsed similarly, when we set root.after(120000, root.destroy), it schedules the 
#root.destroy() function (which closes the tkinter window) to be called after 120,000 milliseconds (or 
#2 minutes) have elapsed. Easily customize functions to fit your own "Game Over." malware-prank script.

# PyInstaller: PyInstaller is a popular tool for packaging Python applications into standalone
# executables. You can use PyInstaller to create an executable file (.exe on Windows, or an
# equivalent binary on other platforms) that includes all the necessary Python dependencies
# and resources. This is a basic example of how you might use PyInstaller to package your GTK
# application-which is already packaged in this repo.
#
# Use PyInstaller to create a standalone executable
# Here, we're using the --onefile option to generate a single executable file
'''Import the necessary modules
from pyinstaller import PyInstaller
from game_over import Game_Over

pyinstaller --onefile game_over.py,,,
#Other than a few on-screen commands in the terminal, that's it. Windows, mac and linux 
#packages from a single cmd snippet. A very usefull and powerful script.
