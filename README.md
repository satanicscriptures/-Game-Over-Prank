# -Game-Over-Prank
Python script for a "Game Over." malware-prank application. Teaching tool; for beginners.
=======
A simple python APP that opens a GUI conatiner with a "click here" button. When pressed, the monitor 
screen goes black and a "GAME OVER" red font appears. The mouse is disabled 
and the screen remains like this, seemingly succumbing to malicious malware offensice attack, as
the P.C. tower (if applicable) beeps every 10 seconds until 2 minutes pass. At this point the app container 
as if nothing happened-much to the relief of any surely panicked potential victim. Simply set 
root.after(10000, beep), it schedules the beep() function to be called after 10,000 milliseconds (or 10 seconds) have elapsed
similarly, when we set root.after(120000, root.destroy), it schedules the root.destroy() function (which
closes the tkinter window) to be called after 120,000 milliseconds (or 2 minutes) have elapsed. Easily
customize functions to fit your own "Game Over." malware-prank script.<---satanicsmores
