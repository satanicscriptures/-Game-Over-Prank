A simple python APP that opens a GUI conatiner with a "click here" button. When pressed, the monitor 
screen goes black and a classic red "GAME OVER" video game font is revealed. The mouse is disabled 
and the screen remains like this while the P.C. tower beeps every 10 seconds for 2 min. then disappears,
surprising a surely panicked would be victim. Or in math-y terms: simply set root.after(10000, beep),
it schedules the beep() function to be called after 10,000 milliseconds (or 10 seconds) have elapsed
similarly, when we set root.after(120000, root.destroy), it schedules the root.destroy() function (which
closes the tkinter window) to be called after 120,000 milliseconds (or 2 minutes) have elapsed. Easily
customize to fit your own pranking-hack script.<---satanicsmores
